# Coding Portfolio

I am a Computer Science student.
This repository is a general overview of my programming work and collects
links to my main projects, developed both during university courses and
through personal practice.

## Project categories

### University projects in C
Projects developed during university exams and exercises.
They focus on:
- C programming fundamentals
- Pointers and dynamic memory management
- Data structures (lists, trees, arrays)
- File input/output
- Code organization and correctness

### Personal projects (web / applications)
Small personal projects developed independently to practice:
- Basic application logic
- Problem solving
- Code structure and clarity

These projects are meant to show how I work outside academic constraints.

### Personal Project
Projects focused on:
